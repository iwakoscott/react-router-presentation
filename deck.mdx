```notes
- React Router is a routing library for React written by Ryan Florence and Michael Jackson!

- What does that mean?
    - A router allows your single page web application to have multiple pages!
    - Or more generally, sometimes you need to react to changes in your application depending on the current URL path.
    - Example: Send new a feature to Mom
```
